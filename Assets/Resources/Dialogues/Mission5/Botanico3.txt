Alexander: "Hello my friend! Looks like you are the chelovek of the day! You surely boosted our morale.
Now, it looks like your actions got the interest of the governments. They gave Mars Society the clearance to search for new places to build laboratories around the planet. They want us to check for suitable places first.
We are talking about caves, sheltered from most of the planet radiations.
Alexander hopes you are not afraid of dark places."
John: "...!"
Alexander: "I have already worked to look for a first suitable place, and you are going to like it because you have already been in that vicinity.
You'll have to go back to the Valles Marineris.
Once you are there you'll have to look for a cave entrance and check the radiation level inside.
That's why I'm giving you my Geiger counter, I have another one to keep working here."

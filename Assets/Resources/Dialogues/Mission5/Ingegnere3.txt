Emma: "Our hero, you have no idea of the excitement back at Earth when I told them of your discovery.
That data is surely going to be useful for the reconnaissance and maybe one day for the colonization of even more far than Mars planets and solar systems."
"..."
Emma: "While you were coming home, I prepared another gift for you darling!
It needs to be tested here on Mars and I had to ask for clearance before being able to work on it.
See, I have noticed how much research potential we have lost since our arrival due to the difficulty of reaching determined places, this should help you in your future explorations.
Here, give it a try later on"
Emma: "I'm sure it will come in handy for what Alexander is going to ask you"
"..."
Emma: "Oh, yes I completely forgot, Alexander asked about you again, this time it's something communicated from Earth while he was looking for informations about the probe. 
Seems our success is going to lead to even more responsibilities from now on"

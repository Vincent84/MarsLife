Emma: "Diagnostics are green and parameters are back to normal, I guess I have to thank you for that! I'd offer you a beer but I'm new to the place, do you know any good pub in the area?
Ahahahah just kidding. So, this is the Tech Lab, where I work at the equipment we'll use to complete our tasks.
Marika is working in the Infirmary, while Alexander is stationed at the Hydroponic Greenhouse, but don't worry, you are my favourite.
Anyway, Alexander has asked about you while you were away, check on him inside the hydroponic greenhouse and tell him I said hi!"

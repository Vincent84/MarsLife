Marika: "We are glad you are back."
Emma: *ktztz* "We have something to tell you!"
Alexander: *ktztz* "And we are sure you are gonna like it, my friend!"
Emma: *ktztz* "While we will be working on what you have delivered us so far, you have been assigned one of the most dangerous and important tasks of this Mission on Mars, straight from the headquarters back on Earth.
Emma: *ktztz* "You have shown everyone of your capabilities, which is why we need you more than ever with this last, epic task."
John: "...?"
Emma: *ktztz* "We are going to plant a flag at the top of the Olympus Mons. The most iconic place of this planet."
Marika: "Of course, we wouldn't risk your life just to plant a flag."
Emma: *ktztz* "Yes, while everyone was researching and exploring, I have been tweaking with the prototype of a very powerful antenna, capable of clearly transmitting high quality video captures wih very little delay. 
It should be able to communicate from here to the base, and from the base directly to Earth, while establishing contact with satellites and probes in case of emergency.
It will be a back up plan, in case something wrong happens to the astronauts that will come on Mars in the future."
Marika: "When you are ready, get on Bertha. All the three of us will make sure to keep you monitored, in order for you to get there safely.
Once you are there, radio communications from the base won't be available until you'll have the antenna installed, so it's crucial that you get in position and install it as soon as possible.
Good luck, John."
Emma: *ktztz* "Good luck, darling!"
Alexander: *ktztz* "Alexander wishes you good luck, comrade."
John: "...!"

Emma: "Thank you for the help!
We've risked a disaster, we need to be more careful from now on..."
John: "..."
Emma: "Cheer up darling! Everything is fixed now and we can get back to work. I have just the task for you. 
So, we got communication from Earth. They want us to analyze the remains of the probe,
which is why I have already set the destination for Bertha to the Noctis Labyrinthus. 
Back in the saddle, there's research to be done! Good luck."

Emma: "Here he is, you took your time darling!
Welcome to my… our base, John. 
I’d like to keep chatting with you, but it seems we have a problem and I need someone to help me with it. 
You are the adventurous type, right?"
John: "..."
Emma: "I knew I could count on you! 
Now, the base has begun its start up sequence but I have noticed some instability in the energy levels, we might risk an inconsistency in the…
Oh well, I don’t want to bother you with the technical stuff, I just need you to get out there and fix the problem. 
Most probably the martian dust has settled on the solar panels, so please be a gentleman and clean them for me, would you?
I’ll contact you through the radio."
John: "..."
Emma: "Oh! I am so full of work that I forget obvious things, you need your equipment first!
Search for your helmet and your backpack, also I have a torch here somewhere, you can take it. 
Don’t forget to equip yourself with a navigator and a pick-shovel as well, you’ll find them throughout the base. 
I’ll be monitoring you from here, now go!"

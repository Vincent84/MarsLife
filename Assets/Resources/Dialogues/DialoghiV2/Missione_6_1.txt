Emma: *ktztz* "I knew I couldn’t trust you even for the most basilar task, Alexander!"
Alexander: *ktztz* "I swear it is not my fault, I did everything right and I’ve also double checked it! 
You were the one checking the calibrations of it."
Emma: *ktztz* "Well, you know how scrupulous I am about my duties, so it cannot be my fault."
Marika: *ktztz* "Team, stay calm. It doesn’t matter who’s guilty of the problem, it might have been something out of our control. 
What matters is that we collaborate in order to fix the problem."
John: “...?”
Marika: *ktztz* ”John? Glad you are back just in time, we are having some problems.
It would be great if you could help us, come speak with me."

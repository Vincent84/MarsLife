Alexander: *ktztz* "Ok, so, I see you have reached the crash site area.
In the meantime, Emma assigned me some research about it.
It took some time, communication with Earth is as fast as internet in Magadan, which means really slow.”
John: "...?"
Alexander: *ktztz* "The crashed probe is the Violin-1, the first to reach Mars in just 60 days, just one year ago.
It was a breakthrough for space travel, the schematics for it were designed in 2020.
However, something went wrong during the approach to the planet, and it smashed into the ground without being able to send data back to Earth about the systems failure."
Emma: *ktztz* "Which means we have the chance to understand what happened, if something has survived the impact."
Alexander: *ktztz* "That’s quite an if."
Emma: *ktztz* "What you are looking for is the Black Box contained in the probe, get it and you’ll make someone’s day back in Utah."
Alexander: *ktztz* "It will also make your day, won’t it?"
Emma: *ktztz* "You know I can’t wait to get my hands on that data."

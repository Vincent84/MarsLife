Marika: "Welcome back John, I'm sorry for the inconvenience but the infirmary is closed. 
Please don't be alarmed with what I'm going to tell you now. 
The Life Support System has run into a critical problem. 
Keeping calm is key to these situations, which is why I'm trying to not be nervous, however I cannot say the same for Alexander and Emma. 
Emma is working on the main issue, but there are some leaks in the system that needs fixing. 
I have to stay here in order to monitor Emma and Alexander stress levels, could you please deal with those leaks? Thank you."

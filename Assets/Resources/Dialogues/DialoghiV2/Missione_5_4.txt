Emma: *ktztz* "Hello John! Happy to have me back as your guide? I'm sure you are.
Now, we are having some problems here at the base that needs fixing so I'll be monitoring you while I take care of some calibrations with Alexander, which is doing the dirty job for me."

Emma: *ktztz* "What you are looking for is a place covered from most of the planet radiations, once you'll have found it I'll track your coordinates and send the data back to Earth.
You are now fully equipped for whatever will come next, so good luck dear!"

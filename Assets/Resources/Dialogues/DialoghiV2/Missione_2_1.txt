Alexander: "Oh oh oh! Here it is, our favourite geologist!  Hello my friend
Isn't this place beautiful? It sort of reminds me of my hometown, except everything here is orange instead of white and there is no smell of fish. 
So, welcome to the hydroponic greenhouse! This is where Alexander takes care of his plants and conducts his research."
John: "..."
Alexander: "I have asked of you because I need to start my research, but in order to do so, I need someone to go out there and start collecting some minerals for me. 
I see you are also interested in rocks, so you do me a favor and you'll also do a favor to yourself, isn't it great?
Don't worry, Alexander will cook a good meal for you after this."
John: "..."
Alexander: "In order to complete this mission, you will need a scanner and a drill. 
Here, take mine, just don't break them, it's a long way to Russia from here. Now go! No time to waste."

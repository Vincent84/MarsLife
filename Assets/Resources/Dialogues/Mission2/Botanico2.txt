Alexander: "Ahah we did it my friend! Back in one piece and with all what I need to conduct my experiments. 
Time to celebrate!"
John: "...!"
Alexander: "Oh, maybe another time, you should go and see Marika, while I set up everything so I can begin.
John: "...?"
Alexander: "She has been angry with Alexander recently, said I was "too rude" and that I should be mindful of "more sensible" people.
I know she is right. Alexander will try to be more careful from now on."

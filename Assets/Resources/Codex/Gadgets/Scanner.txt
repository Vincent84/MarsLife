Scientists on Earth found strong evidence that liquid water flows intermittently on present-day Mars, increasing the chances of the Red Planet serving as a permanent home for humans in the future. 
They discovered what are thought to be large ice deposits just under the surface of Mars. Here not only water can be found, but there's also the chance of finding bacteria and useful minerals. 
The geologist drills the surface to find water and glaciers and to collect samples that are then used as research material.
The drill includes a miniaturized infrared spectrometer, a device used to figure out the physical and chemical properties of the drilled hole.
For topological detections the geologist creates a map of the POI where water and glaciers can be found. From here, it is possible to predict the position of other basins and underground aquifers.
For geological detections the geologist analyses the holes he drills in the ground in order to locate possible deposits of minerals in the area, it is then possible to predict where other deposits are.
For seismic detections the geologist analyses the data collected by the computers in the laboratory to keep track of any seismic activity in the area and sends the data back to Earth for further studies.

In 1996 NAS began researching and developing an accurate electronic inspection method for finding and computing the size of defects on Orbiter tiles. 
Over the next four years a small hand-held instrument was developed to obtain and archive high-resolution 3D surface maps of tile damage. 
This instrument was part of the Electronic Imaging and Mapping System (EIMS) delivered to Kennedy Space Center in 2001.
Over the next year the High Speed 3D Scanner was developed as a 2nd generation instrument. It incorporates significant improvements which make it much faster, more reliable, and easier to use. 
3D processing is done right on board the instrument in real time, and the resultant 3D files are transmitted over a USB 2.0 connection to a PC. 
This results in rapid scans with high-resolution 3D images produced while the instrument is scanning.

NASA is actually working on a project called "High Speed 3D Scanner" to be mounted on a K9 Rover, this high-resolution 3D imaging sensor can perform many of the 3D imaging functions needed for surface robots/rovers 
and space or atmospheric vehicles in the exploration program: creation of planetary terrain maps, ranging, avoidance of surface hazards, imaging and motion sensing for automated rendezvous, 
docking for robot assisted assembly and surface operations. 
The sensor will have the capability to detect and profile targets and terrain at much higher speeds and resolution than existing systems at midrange distances (from centimeters to meters), giving a greater level of autonomy, 
safety, and capability to these operations.
The system was developed for the NASA Mars Rover Program and for inspection of the Shuttle Thermal Protection System. It supports the exploration mission by providing excellent near-to mid-range vision for various robotic applications.
NASA's current research and development effort involves extending the High Speed 3D Scanner to meet additional NASA applications. As technical requirements are defined custom hardware is built and optimized to meet demands. 
NASA is currently focusing on the following three applications: Mars rover instrument placement, a portable high-resolution defect assessment instrument, and in-flight inspection of the Shuttle.
In a Director's Discretionary Fund (DDF) project, NASA demonstrated the scanner's ability to significantly improve the instrument placement capability of the K9 Mars rover. 
The previous system used stereovision to acquire the terrain information needed to place a test instrument on a feature of interest. The High-Speed 3D Scanner improves on the stereovision technique because it achieves higher resolution 
without being as sensitive to natural lighting conditions and texture of the target surface. Because of this, the 3D Scanner works in total darkness, on high contrast scenes, and on smooth non-textured surfaces - all areas where traditional stereovision has difficulty.


In our game, an imaginary improved version of this scanner is built in the spacesuit.

NASA decided on initial specifications for television cameras on the Apollo Command Module (CM) in 1962. Both analog and digital transmission techniques were studied, but the early digital systems still used 
more bandwidth than an analog approach: 20 MHz for the digital system, compared to 500 kHz for the analog system. The video standard for the Block I CM meant that the analog video standard for early Apollo 
missions was set as follows: monochrome signal, with 320 active scan lines, and progressively scanned at 10 frames-per-second (fps). RCA was given the contract to manufacture such a camera. 
It was understood at the time that motion fidelity from such a slow-scan television system (SSTV) would be less than standard commercial television, but deemed sufficient considering that astronauts would not 
be moving quickly in orbit, or even on the Lunar surface. The camera was first tested in space during the Apollo 9 mission in March 1969. 
The camera's dimensions were 269 mm x 165 mm x 86 mm (10.6 in x 6.5 in x 3.4 in) in size, and weighed 3.29 kilograms (7.3 lb). 
It consumed 6.50 watts of power. Its bayonet lens mount allowed for quick changes for the two interchangeable lenses used on Apollo 11: a wide-angle and a lunar day lens.

NASA is currently working on a series of new cameras to be mounted on rovers able to adapt to the martian ambience.

The Instrument Deployment Camera (IDC) is similar to the Navcam navigation cameras onboard the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers, with full color capability added. It has a 45-degree field of view, 
and provides a panoramic view of the terrain surrounding the landing site. This camera will image the workspace in detail to support the selection of the best spots to place down the instruments. 
This camera will take color images of the instruments on the lander's deck and a 3-D view of the region around the lander. 
Information received from the Navcam helps engineers and scientists guide the deployment of the seismometer and the heat flow probe. Scientists can point the camera in any direction, so it can take images to be
combined into a 360-degree panorama of the lander's surroundings.

The Instrument Context Camera (ICC) is mounted just below the deck, on the edge of the lander facing the workspace, which is the area of ground within reach of the arm. The ICC has a "fisheye" field of view of 
120 degrees. It will provide wide-angle views of the entire workspace. Like the Navcam, it is based on a similar camera on Opportunity and Curiosity. It is mounted under the edge of the lander's deck and 
provides a complementary view of the instrument deployment area.

Both cameras have a square charge-coupled device (CCD) detector 1,024 pixels by 1,024 pixels.

In our game, the player uses an imaginary portable version of a camera capable of accomplishing the results of both.

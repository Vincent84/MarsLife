To turn the compass on or off, press R3

Unlike the Earth, Mars and the Moon don't have strong directional magnetic fields, which means traditional compasses don't work on the Mars surface.
This magnetic field is created as the Earth's rotation churns its molten, outer core around its solid inner core, both of which are composed of metals such a nickel and iron.
A compass works due to the north/south polarity generated by the Earth's magnetic field in the same way you have opposite polarities on both ends of a magnet.
Mars has a very weak, highly spatially variable magnetic field due to remnant magnetisation of some of its crust when it did have a magnetic field.
The process that happens on Earth has ceased due to the cooling of the planet's outer-core. 
As a result, Mars no longer has a magnetic field (magnetosphere) like that of Earth, therefore Mars no longer has the type of north/south polarity that a compass requires in order to work in the way it was designed to work,
as it would probably flop around and point in random directions.

The rovers used in scouting missions between 2013 and 2020 rely on high resolution imaging used to pinpoint the location on a locally saved map.
The difference is that rovers don't need to know where they were globally but just locally. Whenever they move they take stereo images of the landscape and 
use these images to create a local map. They identify hazards and assign danger levels to different areas. When they move, wheel odometers track how far they go, then every so often they take another set of photos. 
This is one of the main reasons rovers are slow - they have to continually update their local maps from stereo images.
However, the wheel odometers aren't accurate, and tend to slip in particular terrains, 
so the position has to be updated from the stereo maps and ultimately using the orbiters and high res images, continually updating the position on different scales of map.

In our game, we have a navigation compass working with the communication from the base to the astronaut, but in reality this connection couldn't happen for distances longer than 40 KMs using today's technology and would probably
need the assistance of orbital satellites rotating mars, task that is currently being planned by NASA.

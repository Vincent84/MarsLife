To use the jetpack, press A after jumping

While it's rather unlikely for a jetpack to be phisycally prototyped for a Mars mission, someone has designed an idea for it and submitted it during the NASA Space Apps Challenge.
Mobility on Mars is a real challenge and astronauts are limited by the weight you can bring with you from Earth and the radically different environmental conditions prevent them from using conventional vehicles. 
Moreover the terrain can be rough and an exploration team cannot risk the life of an astronaut by sending him and his vehicle into unknown and difficult to access places. Despite these restrictions, astronauts would not want to go all 
the way to Mars and not being able to explore a crater that could contain the answers to a lot of our questions.

Flying on Mars is very difficult due to the thin atmosphere and hovering with a Jetpack uses a lot of propellant that needs to be made, stored and transported. Therefore, the solution proposed is to use the Jetpack as a grasshopper. 
It means that the astronaut would use a short and powerful impulsion to induce a leap. The main objective is to be able to access the bottom of craters or explore an upper plateau and any other location that is hardly reachable with 
common vehicles.

The team added several innovations to the concept in order to enhance the security, the control and the ergonomics of the jet pack:
An exoskeleton is added to the space suit in order to carry the excess weight of the Jetpack solution but also the astronaut life support unit. It would enable to cover more distance by foot and carry more experiments while providing 
a certain security margin on the accuracy of the jump.
A companion drone for real time mapping would give the data necessary for the real time trajectory optimization of the Jetpack. In addition the drone could also be used as radio relay to communicate with the habitat when line of sight 
is lost due to landscape.
A landing system inspired by prosthetic running sole to absorb Jetpack landing shock and hence helps protect weakened bones of astronauts.
An Extra Vehicular Activity App in order for the astronaut to select the landing spot and visualize the trajectory beforehand. The app is computing the trajectory based on the weather and topographic information sent by the drone. 
It also gives relevant information about fuel consumption, velocity or height.

In our game, a simplified version of this jetpack is used by the player.

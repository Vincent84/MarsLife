Entrenching tools go back at least to the times of the Roman Legion. Julius Caesar, as well as other ancient writers, documented the use of spades and other digging implements as important tools of war. 
The Roman Legion when on the march would dig a ditch and rampart around their camps every night where established camps were not available.
Being too long and heavy to be transported by individual soldiers, entrenching shovels and spades were normally carried in the supply carts (logistics train) of a military column. 
This frequently led to situations in which the infantry did not have access to entrenching equipment when it was needed.
As one U.S. army infantry officer noted, "the intrenching tools of an army rarely get up to the front until the exigency for their use has passed."
In 1870, the U.S. Army introduced the trowel or spade bayonet, intended for individual soldiers as both a weapon and an entrenching tool.
This was followed by the development of separate trowel and spade tools, small one-hand implements that could be carried as part of a soldier's individual equipment.
The first truly modern entrenching tool was invented in 1869 by the Danish officer Mads Johan Buch Linnemann. In 1870, it was patented and supplied to the Danish Army. 
During World War I entrenching tools became extremely important with the introduction of trench warfare. 
Entrenching tools designed for the individual infantryman soon appeared with short straight handles, T-handles, D-handles, and other designs.
In 1938, the (German) "Klappspaten" foldable spade, appeared, being the precursor of all modern spades of this kind, including the 1943 American copy, folding designs became increasingly popular, usually consisting of a fixed handle 
with a folding shovel head, and sometimes incorporating a pick into the design. Like all individual entrenching tools, they were designed to be easily carried as part of an infantry soldier's standard pack equipment.
The United States Army folding spade, or entrenching tool, has evolved from a single fold spade with a straight handle, to a tri-fold design with a modified "D" handle design with all steel construction, 
to a similar light weight plastic and steel tri-fold design adopted by NATO as the standard issue entrenching tool. 
Other folding variants have also been issued. The latest light weight plastic tri-fold design is thirty percent lighter than the all-steel tri-fold was: 1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) instead of 2.25 pounds (1.02 kg).

Above the Earth's atmosphere the solar irradiance is slightly more than 1300 W/m2 (1300 watts per square metre), which is different from Mars.
Mars is over 50 percent farther from the sun than Earth, so it receives less than half as much sunlight.
The Earth's atmosphere is not perfectly transparent to sunlight and about one quarter of the Sun's light is absorbed or scattered before it reaches the surface.
At the Earth's surface, with the Sun directly overhead at local noon (clear dry atmosphere), the solar irradiance is reduced to about 1000 W/m2 (1000 watts per square metre). 
This value is highly variable depending upon such things as the amount of dust and water vapor in the atmosphere. 
At local noon on Mars, with Sun directly overhead, the solar irradiance is 590W/m2 (590 watts per square metre).
All the above measurements are taken with the incident light perpendicular to the absorbing surface. If the sunlight falls on the surface at an angle, less energy will be incident (per square metre) on the surface.

This is one of the main reasons why a spacesuit for a mission on Mars requires a torchlight to be built in, especially for the exploration of darker places like caves.
The first spacesuit to encounter this problem was the "Mercury IVA", the first U.S. spacesuit design operated from 1959 to 1970, which included lights at the tips of the gloves in order to provide visual aid.

The torchlight for a future mission on Mars might be built in the torso part or on the helmet of the spacesuit

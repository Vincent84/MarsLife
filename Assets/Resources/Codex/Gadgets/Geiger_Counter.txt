The Geiger counter is an instrument used for detecting and measuring ionizing radiation used widely in applications such as radiation dosimetry, radiological protection, experimental physics and the nuclear 
industry.
It detects ionizing radiation such as alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays using the ionization effect produced in a Geiger-Muller tube; which gives its name to the instrument.
In wide and prominent use as a hand-held radiation survey instrument, it is perhaps one of the world's best-known radiation detection instruments.
The original detection principle was discovered in 1908 at the Cavendish laboratory, but it was not until the development of the Geiger-Muller tube in 1928 that the Geiger-Muller counter became a practical 
instrument. Since then it has been very popular due to its robust sensing element and relatively low cost. However, there are limitations in measuring high radiation rates and the energy of incident radiation.

There are two main limitations of the Geiger counter. Because the output pulse from a Geiger-Muller tube is always of the same magnitude regardless of the energy of the incident radiation, the tube cannot 
differentiate between radiation types. A further limitation is the inability to measure high radiation rates due to the "dead time" of the tube. This is an insensitive period after each ionization of the gas 
during which any further incident radiation will not result in a count, and the indicated rate is, therefore, lower than actual. Typically the dead time will reduce indicated count rates above about 104 to 105 
counts per second depending on the characteristic of the tube being used. Whilst some counters have circuitry which can compensate for this, for accurate measurements ion chamber instruments are preferred for 
high radiation rates. A further limitation is caused by the background radiation. As almost everything in nature emits radiation and earth is constantly hit by radiation coming from space (cosmic radiation), 
low levels of radiation are difficult to measure. Shielding with lead will help but shielding against cosmic radiation is practically impossible.
